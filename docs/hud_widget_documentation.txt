By default, the widgets except for the status bar will hide when Talon goes in sleep mode, but you can keep them around, or hide them, with the following commands.  
<*head up show <widget name> on sleep/> keeps the chosen widget enabled during sleep mode.  
<*head up hide <widget name> on sleep/> hides the chosen widget when sleep mode is turned on.

On top of being able to turn widgets on and off, you can configure their attributes to your liking.  
Currently, you can change the size, position, alignment, animation and font size.  

<*head up drag <widget name>/> starts dragging the widget.  
<*head up resize <widget name>/> starts resizing the widgets width and height.  
<*head up expand <widget name>/> changes the maximum size of the widget in case the content does not fit the regular width and height.  
By default these two dimensions are the same so the widget does not grow when more content is added.  
<*head up text scale <widget name>/> starts resizing the text in the widget.  
<*head up drop/> confirms and saves the changes of your changed widgets.  
<*head up cancel/> cancels the changes. Hiding a widget also discards of the current changes.

Some widgets like the event log also allow you to change the text direction and alignment  
<*head up align <widget name> left/> aligns the text and the widget to the left side of its bounds.  
<*head up align <widget name> right/> aligns the text and the widget to the right side of its bounds.  
<*head up align <widget name> top/> changes the direction in which content is placed upwards.  
<*head up align <widget name> bottom/> changes the direction in which content is placed downwards.

If you prefer having a more basic animation free set up, or want to switch back to an animated display, you can use the following commands  
<*head up basic <widget name>/> disables animations on the chosen widget.  
<*head up fancy <widget name>/> enables animations on the chosen widget.
